To interpret user needs for software creation, I focus on understanding the underlying problems they aim to solve rather than just their stated requests. User stories are very helpful here—they break down needs that might be tough to state into more humanized narratives, like “As a [user], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].” User stories would help to empathize with users, prioritize features based on value, and avoid overcomplicating solutions, while also allowing easy agile planning. By breaking needs into small, testable goals, user stories bridge the gap between abstract desires and actionable development steps.

My approach to developing software programs is iterative and pragmatic. First I would start by defining a clear purpose, then build a minimal, functional prototype to test core assumptions. Understanding feedback drives refinement—whether from users or technical constraints—ensuring the solution evolves purposefully. It is also important to emphasize clean, maintainable code and leverage tools like
version control and automated testing to keep quality high and adaptability intact.

 In the future when incorporating agile processes I think it is necessary to embrace flexibility and collaboration. I’d adopt sprints to deliver incremental value, hold regular stand-ups for alignment, and use retrospectives to learn and adjust. A good agile team member is communicative, adaptable, and outcome-focused—someone who listens actively, pivots when needed, and keeps the team’s shared goal in sight. This would create an environment that is focused on fostering trust and transparency, I’d aim to contribute to a team that thrives on change and delivers real impact.
